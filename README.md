# GPT Generalization, Fairness, and Optimization Benchmark with Integrated Solutions

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script (`leetcode_inspired_100_gpt_benchmark.py`) aimed at benchmarking the generative abilities of a machine learning model in the dimensions of Generalization, Fairness, and Optimization. This version of the script incorporates both the problems and their corresponding solutions. The benchmark consists of 100 coding problems adapted from LeetCode, each focusing on different aspects such as Generalization, Fairness, and Optimization.

## Structure

- `problems_metadata`: A list of dictionaries, each containing metadata for a coding problem. Metadata includes an ID, description, tags, and the expected aspect for model performance (Generalization, Fairness, or Optimization).
- `gpt_code_for_problems`: A dictionary containing the GPT-generated solutions for each problem.
- `test_functions`: Python functions designed to test the solutions for each aspect.
- `run_benchmark()`: A function that runs the generated code against the test functions and returns the results.

## How to Use

1. **Download the Script**: Clone this repository and download `leetcode_inspired_100_gpt_benchmark.py`.
2. **Run the Benchmark**: Execute the script. It will automatically run the generated code against the test functions and print the results.

## Customization

- You can update the `problems_metadata` and `test_functions` according to your specific requirements.
- Replace the test functions with actual test cases to get a more accurate assessment of the generated code.

## Output

The script will output the benchmark results, detailing whether the code for each problem passed, failed, or resulted in an error.

## Assessment Criteria

The script also includes criteria for assessing the code in terms of Generalization, Fairness, and Optimization. This helps in understanding how well the code performs in these aspects.

## Future Work

- Integration of more aspects like Transfer Learning, Model Complexity, etc.
- Inclusion of advanced metrics for a more comprehensive performance analysis.
- Potential for real-world applications in automated code reviews and AI-driven development.
