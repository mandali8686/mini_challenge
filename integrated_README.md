# GPT Generalization Benchmark with Integrated Solutions

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script (`integrated_gpt_generalization_benchmark.py`) designed to benchmark the generalization abilities of a generative model. Unlike the initial version, this script includes both the problems and their solutions. The benchmark comprises 100 coding problems across different topics like Handling Unseen Data, Overfitting Prevention, Regularization Techniques, and Data Augmentation.

## Structure

- `generalization_problems_metadata`: A list of dictionaries, each containing metadata for a coding problem. Metadata includes an ID, description, tags, and the expected aspect for model generalization.
- `gpt_code_for_problems`: A dictionary containing the GPT-generated solutions for each problem.
- `generalization_test_functions`: Python functions designed to test the solutions.
- `run_generalization_benchmark()`: A function that runs the generated code against the test functions and returns the results.

## How to Use

1. **Download the Script**: Clone this repository and download `integrated_gpt_generalization_benchmark.py`.
2. **Run the Benchmark**: Execute the script. It will automatically run the generated code against the test functions and print the results.

## Customization

- You can update the `generalization_problems_metadata` and `generalization_test_functions` as per your requirements.
- Replace the test functions with actual test cases to properly assess the generated code.

## Output

The script prints the benchmark results, showing whether the code for each problem passed the test, failed, or resulted in an error.

## Future Work

- Integration of more aspects like Transfer Learning, Model Complexity, etc.
- Advanced metrics for performance analysis.
